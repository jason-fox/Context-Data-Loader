urn:ngsi-ld:AgriSoil:sand,AgriSoil,Sandy,,"Sandy soil is mostly sand particles. It feels gritty to the touch. Because sand particles don’t absorb water but create a lot of space in between for water to move, sandy soil drains quickly and nutrients wash away. On the plus side, sandy soil doesn’t suffer much from compaction and is very good for plants that like loose soil",http://aims.fao.org/aos/agrovoc/s_9921
urn:ngsi-ld:AgriSoil:silt,AgriSoil,Silty,,"Silt is between sand and clay in terms of particle size, and it’s mostly composed of quartz. Silty soil is comprised of at least 80% silt. When dry, silty soil feels like flour. When wet, it’s loose like sand, making it prone to erosion. Silty soil can be the most fertile soil in the world, but without roots and other components to hold it down, it’s likely to wash awa",http://aims.fao.org/aos/agrovoc/s_4444
urn:ngsi-ld:AgriSoil:chalk,AgriSoil,Chalky,,"Chalk soil contains chalk and limestone. It’s larger grained and stonier than other soils. Because the particles are bigger, it drains really well but doesn’t keep any moisture. It’s basically like sandy soil. Chalk soil also breaks down organic matter much faster, meaning you’ll find it challenging keeping your soil fertile.",http://aims.fao.org/aos/agrovoc/s_1897
urn:ngsi-ld:AgriSoil:peat,AgriSoil,Peaty,,"Peat soil is the opposite of chalk soil, where it’s so acidic that organic matter has difficulty breaking down, and so creates peat. It will feel spongy because of all the organic matter. The high amount of organic matter increases aeration, but because the organic matter is very slow in breaking down, not a lot of nutrients are being released for plants to absorb.",http://aims.fao.org/aos/agrovoc/s_8927
